# Software Architecture, SOLID Principles & Design Patterns in Java - Resource

Welcome to the **Software-Architecture-SOLID-Design-Patterns-in-Java-Resource** repository!  
This repository is a comprehensive collection of materials, code examples, and explanations to help you master software architecture best practices, SOLID principles, and common design patterns using Java.

---

## üìö What‚Äôs Inside?

- **SOLID Principles:**  
  Detailed explanations and Java code examples for each SOLID principle (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion).
- **Design Patterns:**  
  Classic and modern design patterns implemented in Java, including but not limited to:
  - Creational Patterns (Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype)
  - Structural Patterns (Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Proxy)
  - Behavioral Patterns (Observer, Strategy, Command, State, Template Method, Iterator, Chain of Responsibility, Mediator)
- **Software Architecture Concepts:**  
  Guidance on modularization, separation of concerns, dependency injection, and scalable application design.
